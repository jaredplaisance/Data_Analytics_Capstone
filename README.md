My capstone project is aimed at unraveling the dynamics of video game sales. The
project seeks to address the question of how video game sales vary across different
platforms, genres, and regions over time and what factors contribute to the success of top-
selling video games in each market. This is vital given the increasingly competitive
landscape of the video game industry, where companies are continually striving to
navigate the complexities of consumer preferences, technological advancements, and
market trends.

The scope of the project consists of an analysis of different factors that influence
video game sales. This includes examining platform preferences, genre preferences, and
publisher preferences. By diving into these categories, the project aims to identify the key
drivers that contribute to sales performance.

To achieve these objectives, the project utilizes a data-driven approach by leveraging
a large dataset for sales data on video games. The dataset includes a wide range of
variables, such as platform availability (e.g., PlayStation, Xbox, Wii), genre
classifications (e.g., action, adventure, sports), and publisher classifications (e.g.,
Nintendo, Electronic Arts, Activision). Through data collection and analysis, the project
aims to uncover insights that can inform strategic decision-making within the video game
industry.

In terms of methodology, the project adopts a structured approach inspired by the
CRISP-DM framework, which guides the various stages of the data analysis process. This
includes data understanding, data preparation, exploratory data analysis, modeling,
evaluation, and deployment. By following this methodology, the project ensures a
systematic approach to data analysis, allowing for the identification of meaningful
patterns and trends within the data.


In addition to leveraging statistical analysis techniques, the project also utilizes the
Python programming language and various libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib,
Seaborn, scikit-learn, and SciPy for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling.
These tools enable the project to effectively handle and analyze large volumes of data,
uncovering valuable insights that can inform strategic decision-making within the video
game industry.
